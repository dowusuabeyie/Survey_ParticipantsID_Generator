Random Generator of Sample Index
 
Like Kish grid in survey research for random selection of members in household to be interviewed, this generator, randomly selects multiple individuals to be interviewed instead of one at a time. Interactively applying the Kish is tedious, but this solves that quickly. Just a simple generator that can easily be replicated in Excel. What is more, this online version makes it easy for enums to generate on the go on their CAPI/Tablets

This is created for the project QSMS by MLJE, Ghana.
